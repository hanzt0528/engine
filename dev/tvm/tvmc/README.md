### Python Package Installation
TVM package

Depending on your development environment, you may want to use a virtual environment and package manager, such as virtualenv or conda, to manage your python packages and dependencies.

The python package is located at tvm/python There are two ways to install the package:

Method 1
This method is recommended for developers who may change the codes.

Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to tell python where to find the library. For example, assume we cloned tvm on the directory /path/to/tvm then we can add the following line in ~/.bashrc. The changes will be immediately reflected once you pull the code and rebuild the project (no need to call setup again)

```
export TVM_HOME=/path/to/tvm
export PYTHONPATH=$TVM_HOME/python:${PYTHONPATH}
```
Method 2
Install TVM python bindings by setup.py:

# install tvm package for the current user
# NOTE: if you installed python via homebrew, --user is not needed during installaiton
#       it will be automatically installed to your user directory.
#       providing --user flag may trigger error during installation in such case.
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9  # This is required for mac to avoid symbol conflicts with libstdc++
cd python; python setup.py install --user; cd ..

### check install tvmc
```
source ~/.bashrc
python -m tvm.driver.tvmc --help
```
